1,"This table replaces archived table 21-10-0023-01 (formerly CANSIM 360-0005)."
2,"Data from this table reflect important improvements Statistics Canada made to its methods and processes used to compile its annual economic statistics. Users are advised to use caution in making comparisons between current series and previously terminated series. For more information on the Integrated Business Statistics Program and the source of these changes, consult the information found under the Related information tab under the section Source (Surveys and statistical programs): Survey of Service Industries: Engineering Services."
3,"Estimates for the most recent year are preliminary. Preliminary data are subject to revision. Due to rounding, components may not add to total. Scaling may also affect the calculation of ratios."
4,"Operating revenue excludes investment income, capital gains, extraordinary gains and other non-recurring items."
5,"Operating expenses exclude write-offs, capital losses, extraordinary losses, interest on borrowing, and other non-recurring items."
6,"Salaries, wages, commissions and benefits include vacation pay and commissions for all employees for whom a T4 slip was completed. This category also includes the employer portion of employee benefits for items such as Canada/Québec Pension Plan or Employment Insurance premiums. Salaries and wages do not include working owners' dividends nor do they include the remuneration of owners of unincorporated business. Therefore the relative level of salaries, wages, commissions and benefits will be lower in industries where unincorporated businesses are significant contributors."
7,"Operating profit margin is derived as follows: operating revenue minus operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of operating revenue. The derived figure excludes corporation income tax paid by incorporated businesses and individual income tax paid by unincorporated businesses. For unincorporated businesses, operating profit margin includes unpaid remuneration to partners and proprietors, which is not recorded as salaries, wages and benefits. Therefore the profit estimate will be higher in industries where unincorporated proprietorships and partnerships are significant contributors."
